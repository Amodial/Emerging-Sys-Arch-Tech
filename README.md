# Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech
The goal of this class is to develop a project with thermostat control system using a Rasberry Pi with temperature sensor, LEDs, buttons, jumper wires, and a LCD Display. The system will operate as a state machine using Off, Heat, and Cool controlled by their respective buttons. The LCD displays the current time, temperature, and thermostat state, alternating every few seconds. The system sends status updates (state, current temperature, and setpoint) to a remote server via serial communication every 30 seconds. Developed as part of CS350 - Embedded Systems, this project demonstrates hardware-software integration, state machine design, real-time system threading, and serial communication. The code is written in Python, using libraries like gpiozero, adafruit_ahtx0, and adafruit_character_lcd. To use, connect the hardware as per the pin configuration, install dependencies, and run the program. Press CTRL-C to exit cleanly.
